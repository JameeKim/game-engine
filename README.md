# Personal Game Engine (Work in Progress)

This is a game engine I am making as a hobby and a learning experience. It is
written in Rust programming language.

## Structure

This engine is powered by an ECS architecture. The specific library it is using
is [legion]. All parts are going to be very modular in nature, but it is not
fully planned out in detail yet.
